# Blinkit Dashboard Development using Power BI

In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze real-time sales and operational data of Blinkit, an instant grocery delivery platform. The objective was to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, number of orders, average delivery time, product demand, and regional performance to gain actionable insights.

The dataset used was cleaned and pre-processed before visualization. I designed dynamic visuals including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps, integrated with slicers and filters for user interactivity. DAX functions were used for advanced calculations like revenue trends, top-selling products, and performance comparisons across regions.

This dashboard helped simulate a real-time analytics environment for decision-making and performance tracking, demonstrating how data visualization can drive business efficiency.

**Key Features:**

* Data Cleaning & Transformation: Imported and preprocessed a real-time-like dataset using Power Query Editor.

* Data Modeling: Built data relationships and performed calculations using DAX to create new KPIs such as:

* Total Revenue

* Order Volume

* Average Delivery Time

* Most Demanded Products

* Region-wise Sales Performance

**Visualization:** Developed dynamic visuals including line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, and geo maps to track regional trends.

**User Interactivity:** Implemented filters, slicers, and drill-through pages to enhance data exploration and user experience.
